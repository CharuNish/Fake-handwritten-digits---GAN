# DCGAN Handwritten Digits Generator

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using PyTorch, aimed at generating realistic handwritten digits. The model comprises two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is tasked with creating images that resemble handwritten digits, while the discriminator evaluates whether the images are real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). This project aims to showcase the capabilities of GANs in generating new, convincing images of handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used in this project, which is a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each being a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a digit (0 through 9).
